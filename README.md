# CSE 848 Project --- Abandoned Branch

This branch is work to evolve an encoding for the discrete `n-legs` problem.
The approach follows the project proposal more closely.
It was abandoned for the current master branch, which has a completely separate git history.
This code is squirreled away as an orphan branch for safekeeping.


## Credits

This implementation draws on several open-source packages, most notably Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms for Python (DEAP).
Both the package and (adapted) example usage from the package's documentation were employed in this implementation.
